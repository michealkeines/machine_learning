let say we take x, y random value and we got i,j as output, l,m are the actual value, different is i - x, j - y, if we plot this funtion, that is the final output, we will get a graph

we cant just take out the excat number that value if off, ie, if current is 8 and excpeted is 4, we cant just add 4 to all the output numbers

as all the input are interdependent, we need to find the minium value for the funtion funtion in graph, and use that to reduct, this we are reducing evently wtihout breaking depenedency, if we dont this, if we repeat this proccess if we reach point where it will start to go back up again, we can stop there

we can also visualtize this as fine level contour, level contours are concentric ciccle around an origin, and points in this circumference of the circle have same value from the function 

so if we are
