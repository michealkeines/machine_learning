most of the problems is will about find area under a graph

integral is about find a funtion that will give area under the graph

we ignore alot of stuff, because we are thinking abouot it reaching 0

tangent of the of point we are looking at the graph

so lets say we have some graph with equation  t^2,

if we want to knonw at particular point in time, what was the value, then we have input t

so if we take derivatte of the input equation, we will get rate of change for small values reaching to zero

then we can apply this input t to get the particulate value

this can help us fine the y value in the graph given a x value

because as human i can just look at it and find the value, but for computers
to get that, now we have an method

product rule

chain rule

exponent rule

any number power something is just e power log of that number x something

with dufferentiation, we have a funtion and we find the value of a function at a give poin

with integral, we have the derivate and we find the funtion that will give out this derviate, + c is just that many constant can have same derviate

how area under a curve is related with slope of an different funtion

taylor series

if we have function that is not a polynomical, using that will be hard

so we have to find polynomicall funtion that forms the samw curve for certain limits

we have three unknown, const (c0), c1, c2


const = will match output of the polynomicall funtion we are trying to match for a give point eg, 0

c1 = will match the derviate of the polynomical function we are tryiing to match for a given point

c2 = will match the second derviate

this way we can mimic the polynomical funtion around a point using quadratic equations

eg

cos(x) is our polynomical function

1 - 1/2x^2 is the 2 derviate qudratic equation that can mimic cos(x)

we can add more dervates to imporve the over all equation

this is done using talyors equations
