what is a random variable?

every allowed value is associated with a probability (of the random variable taking that value or value range)

Gaussian Distribution is the bell curve, where the highest probabiliity is in the center and it fall gradually in the sides

```
Let’s assume we know that 1% of women over the age of 40 have breast cancer. 
[p(cancer)=0.01]

 
Let’s assume that 90% of women who have breast cancer will test
positive for breast cancer in a mammogram.

 
[p(positive test|cancer)=0.9]

 
Eight percent of women that do NOT have cancer will also test positive.
[p(positive test|no cancer)=0.08]
What is the probability that a woman has cancer if she tests positive [p(cancer|positive test)]?

 
We will call p(cancer) = P(A), and the P(positive test) = P(B). We want to know P(A|B)–the probability of having cancer if you have a positive test.

 
Using Bayes’ theorem, we calculate that the likelihood that a woman has breast cancer, given a positive test equals approximately 0.10. This makes intuitive sense as (1) this result is greater than 1% (the percent of breast cancer in the general public).
