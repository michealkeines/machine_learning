matrix vector multiplication

if we multiple two similar feature vectors, we will get a big product values

if we multiply two not so similar feature vectors, we will get product less or new to zero value

component of vector in 2d plane

the cooridinate will be the transpose ploted

to find the x cordinate we use hyp x cos 
to find the y cordinate we use hyp x sin 

hyp is the transpose 


this is for single component, that is a vector a (something, something) along the origin (0,0)

if two components a, b

final will be a x b x cos

Dot Product measures agreement between two vectors
