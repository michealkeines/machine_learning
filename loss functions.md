on a specific training data instance, loss function effectively measures the error made by the machine on that particular training data.

## Squared Error Function

The squared error on the ith training data element is the squared difference between the ouput yielded by the model and the expected or target output

total loss during training ie some of error for all instances

reducing this overall loss for a given training set gives us the good working model
